# Data-Analysis-on-Jay-Chou 周杰倫數據分析

A Python project using Spotify API data and data I compiled myself to analyze songs from Jay Chou's studio albums (up to 2016).

Some key takeaways are that:

- Jay Chou's most-frequent collaborating lyricist is 方文山 and most-frequent collaborating arranger is 林邁可.

- The longer a Jay Chou song is, the more likely that it will be popular on Spotify.

- Jay Chou's most used keys are C and D major. Jay Chou hasn't used F#M/GbM in his studio albums yet as of 2016.
